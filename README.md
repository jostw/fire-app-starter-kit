# Fire.app Starter Kit

[Fire.app](http://fireapp.kkbox.com/) is a great tool to build prototypes. 
However, porting a Fire.app project into modern front end workflow needs some extra efforts.
This project is built for development using Fire.app and Grunt within the same structure.

## Overview 

This project includes the following tools.

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)

## Getting Started 

First, clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/jostw/fire-app-starter-kit.git
```

1. For Fire.app development, just use Fire.app to watch the folder and start building your apps.

2. For Grunt development, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and Compass are required.

- Use ``` npm start ``` for watching files and developing with a static server.

- Use ``` npm run build ``` for minification.
